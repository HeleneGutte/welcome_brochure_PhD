    "text": "If you are going to participate in a conference, going on a scientific cruise or similar you need to get permission for that work related travel beforehand. On the KUS-Portal (https://www.kus.uni-hamburg.de/en.html) you can find the form that needs to be filled out as well as any other work-related traveling. It is recommended to look up all possible costs (airplane, train, hotel, conference fee, “Auslandstagegeld” https://www.fid.uni-hamburg.de/arvvwv.pdf) before filling out the form because you can ask the uni for an advance of ~80% of the expected traveling costs if they will be higher than 200 Euro. But you can also get all of your travel expenses back at once after the travel. The university does not pay every hotel price, how much per night the university is okay with and how much money per day (“Auslandstagegeld” for food etc.) you get is depending on where you are traveling. You can find the current list in the “ARVVwV”-PDF (https://www.kus.uni-hamburg.de/en/themen/dienstreisen/rechtsvorschriften.html); the PDF sadly only exists in German. After you filled out the form for business trips and got it signed by the responsible Professor and budget/resource manager, send it to our secretary laura.schmidt-1@uni-hamburg.de so that she can forward it to the responsible bureau of the university. Laura will send you the form back after it got accepted by the bureau.\nAfter your return you can fill out the form to get your traveling costs back from the university (KUS-Portal; “Reisekostenabrechnung”). The filled out form plus all needed expense receipts (conference fee, letter of attendance, hotel costs, train/airplane bookings, tourist fees etc.) should be sent as one PDF to Laura so she can forward it to the responsible bureau, they will write you if and how much they will pay.\nYou can find a checklist of what to do before and after traveling here."

    "text": "HiWi contracts\nIf you want/need to employ a HiWi there is also some helpful information how to organize that:\nBecause the HR office needs to set up the HiWi contract you need to plan ahead. The current deadlines for HiWi contracts are 6 weeks before the planned start of the contract. During vacation time the deadline can expand to 8 weeks before the start of the contract. (Laura knows the most current deadline)\nLaura needs the following information from you to send to the HR office for the contract:\n\nfull name of your planned HiWi person\nmobile phone number + E-Mail address of your planned HiWi person\nduration of the contract: from xx.xx.xxxx to xx.xx.xxxx\nPSP/WBS element (the money pot)\nhow many working hours the HiWi will get in the contract. There are 2 possibilities for HiWi contracts: full contracts and half contracts. Which one you choose depends on how much work you need/want to be done by your HiWi and also how much you can spend on HiWis (ask your supervisor or the person in charge of your money pot). A half contract means 41-43 working hours per month. A full contract means 83-86 working hours per month. If it is the lower or the higher amount of working hours depends on the health insurance of your planned HiWi person (still health insured via family insurance or insured by himself/herself/themselves). Because different health insurance situations allow different amounts of earned money by the insured person.\n\nAfter you send the information to Laura she will contact your planned HiWi person (and supervisor/person in charge of your money pot) and will organize everything else needed for the contract.\nWhen your HiWi then finally starts working you are the person responsible for your HiWi, which means you have to make sure that he/she/they gets a safety briefing if needed and your HiWi is not the only person in the building while working (especially if it is a bachelor student). Therefore you shall always know when your HiWi is in the institute’s buildings for working. In none of our current buildings is something like a system to log in and out when you come and go for work, therefore there is no real control when and for how long your HiWi works and if the HiWi really works the amount of hours that you pay for. Hence it is recommended that you set up a broad working schedule/plan with your HiWi (e.g. the HiWi writes you at which days from when to when he/she/they plan to work in the upcoming weeks etc.) or ask them to write down the hours in a shared Excel Document etc."

You can obtain time-sheet templates as Excel files from Laura or - preferably - from the financial manager for EU projects, Mina Nasseh (mina.nasseh@uni-hamburg.de). You will also have to provide a very short summary of your work (a few keywords). From our experience, you should remind yourself about the requirement to record your time, as your supervisor will not necessarily have that on his / her mind. Every year or so, Mina will ask you to send to her the filled and signed time sheets (printed originals required) for financial reporting.\n\n\nPresentations and Posters\nIf you plan to give a presentation or create a poster, make sure to acknowledge the project. Usually, there is an official disclaimer, which is sent around occasionally by the project manager of your project, but is likely also to be found on the project website.The EU flag should usually also be displayed. It is important to adhere to this obligation, as failure to do so can, in theory, lead to withdrawal of funding money. You can simply add the disclaimer to the last slide of your presentation:\n\n\n\nEU Disclaimer\n\n\n\n\nPublishing\nIf you publish a paper that acknowledges EU funding, be aware that it should be published as “Gold Open Access”, as the project has funding reserved for that purpose (publishing Open Access can be quite costly). Also, you need to upload the published manuscript on a public server (for example the UHH repository “FIS”, https://www.fis.uni-hamburg.de/). You should check whether you have the rights to do so (e.g. CC-BY license) beforehand, however.\n\n\nMeetings and Deliverables\nYou will likely also be asked to participate in the annual meeting of the project, either in person or online; a meeting usually doesn’t last longer than a week.\nAs in most third-party projects, you will likely be asked to contribute to deliverable reports. That means writing a (usually relatively short) text on your work as it relates to your work-package’s deliverable, which will then be integrated into the fitting report section by your supervisor. Depending on your supervisor, you might also have more or less reporting responsibility, however."

You can walk or take public transport from here to the museum harbour Övelgönne and the Elbe beach. Here, in addition to historic ships, you can also discover several bars and restaurants located next to the beach. The “Strandperle” bar is particularly well-known and very popular with locals and tourists.\n \n\n\n\nAurel\nWhere: Bahrenfelder Str. 157, 22765 Hamburg, S Bahn Altona\nWhat: A fun and hip bar with friendly interior, snacks, and a selection of cocktails as well as outdoor seating.\n \nAltes Mädchen\nWhere: Lagerstraße 28b, 20357 Hamburg, S Bahn Sternschanze \nWhat: The Braugasthaus offers good beer from its own brewery and home-style brewhouse cuisine, plus a cosy flair in an otherwise very lively district, the Schanzenviertel.\n \nGoldfischglas\nWhere: Bartelsstraße 30, 20357 Hamburg, S Bahn Sternschanze\nWhat: Cocktails and draught beer in a bar with a casual ambience, DJs and a compact dance floor.\n \nZum tanzenden Einhorn\nWhere: Hammer Steindamm 108, 20535 Hamburg, U Bahn Hammer Kirche\nWhat: Medieval tavern with warm cuisine and delicious drinks. A real Hamburg original even for non-nerds (but also for nerds).\n\n\n\nThe university offers a variety of sports courses on their website: Hochschulsport. The courses change each semester, new courses usually start in April and October. You can attend over 100 different courses with the Flexicard, but for some courses you have to book a slot for each week. The Flexicard can be purchased for 3 or for 6 months. The courses which you can attend with the Flexicard are marked with a ♥ on the Hochschulsport website. All other courses can be booked individually. These courses run usually one semester.\nThe Hochschulsport offers also skiing or snowboard camps and in summer surfing and kitesurfing camps.\nA highlight that Hamburg and the Hochschulsport have to offer are the many different water sports such as sailing, kayaking, rowing and kanupolo.\n\n\n\nMany cinemas in Hamburg show films in English or the original language (often with German subtitles). In the programs they have the note OmU (original with subtitles). Here is a lst of cinemas, where you have the best chances of finding movies in original language (but big cinemas like Cinemaxx occasionally also have some):\nAbaton Kino\nAllendeplatz 3 / Ecke Grindelhof, 20146 Hamburg\nFilmRaum\nMüggenkampstraße 45, 20257 Hamburg\nLichtmess Kino\nGausstraße 25, 22765 Hamburg\nMetropolis Kino\nKleine Theaterstraße 10, 20354 Hamburg\nSavoy Filmtheater\nSteindamm 54, 20099 Hamburg\nThe Savoy also has a Sneak Preview in English.\nStudio Kino\nBernstorffstraße 93 - 95, 22767 Hamburg"
